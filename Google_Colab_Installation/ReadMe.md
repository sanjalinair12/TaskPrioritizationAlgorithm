# Google Colab Installation
The AhToVik algorithm is implemented and simulated in Google Colab for the search and rescue scenario with three sets of tasks and "n" number of robots of each type. The user is intended to provide the details of each set of robots and the initial values for the criteria, which are provided in the robot_criteria_populated.xlxs file in this folder. The user can directly upload this .xlxs file in Google Colab following the steps in the DATA_INPUT_INSTRUCTIONS.md file.

# Project Data

Since GitHub cannot natively display .xlsx files, the .csv version provides a preview for the input data sheets.
The robot_criteria_populated.xlsx file has three sheets, namely, comparison criteria, robots, and tasks, which provide all the necessary inputs for the Search&Rescue_with_input_options.py code.
